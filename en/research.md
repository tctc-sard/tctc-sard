Through the integration of the clinical database of the Alliance, the results of clinical trials, and the database of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, SARD-related research can be conducted, as follows:
1. Establishing long-term follow-up of SARD patients in Taiwan: Long-term follow-up of SARD patients in the Alliance to understand the progression and prognosis of the disease and increase the representation of the study population.
2. Research for the risk of special diseases in Taiwan's new drug trials: follow-up status of extended tests or new drug after listing, can analyze data on specific disease risks in Taiwan (such as tuberculosis and viral hepatitis), the research results would be competitive internationally.
3. Identification of novel biomarkers: The detection of biological specimens by the autoantibody detection platform of the Alliance, combined with basic research, can discover novel biomarkers and confirm them using the platform constructed by TCTC-SARD.
4. Early phase clinical trials of new therapeutic technologies: For the new therapeutic technologies (such as cell therapies and immunotherapy) announced by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, phase I of clinical trials will be carried out through the results of the disease animal model to enhance Taiwan's international competitiveness.
5. Data analysis by using artificial intelligence (AI): Integrating SARD patients' treatment data and bioinformatics into big data, combined with the database from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, using AI's deep machine learning methods to classify and predict to develop SARD's precision medicine.
