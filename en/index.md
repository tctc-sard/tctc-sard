## About us
Systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARD), a constellation of chronic autoimmune diseases with systemic involvement, mainly include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM). Given an involvement of systemic organs with the potential organ failure, SARD are categorized as catastrophic illness by National Health Insurance Administration.Based on the enhanced insights into immunopathogenesis of SARD and an advancement of biopharmaceutics, increasing clinical trials of new therapeutic agents such as biologics and small molecules inhibitors have been conducted for RA and spondyloarthropathies. However,  little effective drugs are available for the treatment of the other SARD, such as lupus nephritis, neuropsychiatric lupus, SARD-related interstitial lung disease. Thus, new therapeutic products are unmet needed, and international pharmaceutical company-sponsored clinical trials will be conducted in our consortium.
In order to carry out international and domestic clinical trials to improve the clinical care quality of SARD patients and promote the development of Taiwan's related biomedical industry, multi-center trials conducted by Taiwan Clinical Trial Consortium will effectively screen, quickly enroll participants and strictly control the quality of trials. Therefore, we have integrated the clinicians of several important medical centers in Taiwan to form the "Taiwan Clinical Trial Consortium for Systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (TCTC-SARD)" to enhance Taiwan's international competitiveness, promote the quality of trials and research, and improve ranking or TCTC-SARD.

SARD is a non-profit clinical trial consortium, divided into six systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases,including SLE, RA, pSS, SSc, IIM, and spondyloarthropathies (ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis). Each disease can involve vital organs, such as SLE with nephritis, SARD complicated with interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, and spondyloarthropathies with uveitis. In addition, these diseases often combine with comorbidities, such as early arteriosclerosis and osteoporosis. The optimal therapeutic recommendations through TCTC-SARD will provide holistic care for SARD patients. In additon, the members of TCTC-SARD will share clinical care experience and patient-reported outcomes. Therefore, the vision of TCTC-SARD is to make Taiwan as one of the leading countries for international clinical trials and new drug applications for SARDs; the goal of TCTC-SARD is to enable all members to share clinical comprehensive databases, biological specimens, autoantibodies/novel biomarkers-detecting platform and together perform PI-initiated research or clinical trials.

## Mission Statement
1. To establish a clinical trial consortium for systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases in Taiwan, to facilitate the implementation of standardized multi-center clinical trials of SARD, and to enhance the international competitiveness of Taiwan's new drug applications and clinical trials in these diseases.
2. Through international clinical trials and international seminars, it promotes international academic communication and share information and resources , and therefore fosters international clinical trial leaders in Taiwan.
3. Establish laboratory platform to detect SARD-specific autoantibodies, perform biological specimen testing, provide the best basis for clinical diagnosis, and discover novel biomarkers. These novel autoantibodies may be the product-oriented PI-initiated clinical trials.
4. Integrate clinical database, laboratory data and clinical trial results into an electronic clinical data bank, and then combine the database of the Ministry of Health and Welfare to enable the members of the Alliance to perform basic and clinical research. Based on electronic clinical data bank, we will establish the optimal diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for SARD.
5. Using artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning technology, big data analysis for integrated electronic database will develop accurate prediction mode of SARD (personalized treatment or personalized therapy).
