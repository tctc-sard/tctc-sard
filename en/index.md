## About us
Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease (SARD) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease that can invade the whole body, and is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause vital organ failure, such as kidneys caused by systemic lupus erythematosus. Central neuropathy and SARD complicated by lung disease, so these diseases have been listed as major injuries by the National Health Insurance Agency. Due to the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and the advancement of biotechnology and medicine, the therapeutic drug biologics or small molecule inhibitors that have been targeted by immune cells or immune molecules have been effectively used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or spondyloarthropathy. For other SARDs, there are still no effective treatments for clinical use, but the research and development of new drugs in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical giants are springing up, and clinical trials will be conducted in the future. In order to carry out international and domestic clinical trials to improve the clinical care quality of SARD patients and promote the development of Taiwan's related biomedical industry, a multi-center trial conducted by the Clinical Trial Alliance will effectively screen and quickly store cases and strictly control the quality of trials. Therefore, we have integrated the clinicians of several important medical centers in Taiwan to form the "Taiwan Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatology Clinical Trial Cooperation Alliance" (TCTC-SARD) to enhance Taiwan's international competitiveness, and the quality of trials and research.

SARD is a non-profit clinical trial consortium, divided into 6 systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases - including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, sedative, scleroderma, immune-related inflammatory myopathy, and spondyloarthropathy (azenic spondylitis, dry arthritis). Each disease can invade vital organs, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, SARD complicated with interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension, and spondyloarthropathy with ocular lesions. In addition, these diseases often combine with comorbidities, such as early arteriosclerosis and osteoporosis. The guidelines for the development of treatment strategies through TCTC-SARD will be provided to provide patient-wide care and share clinical care experience and outcomes among members of the Alliance. Therefore, the vision of TCTC-SARD is to make Taiwan one of the leading countries for clinical trials and new drug applications for international SARDs; the goal of TCTC-SARD is to enable all members to share clinical comprehensive databases, biological specimens, autoantibody detection platforms and novelty. Biomarkers and together perform PI-initiated research or clinical trials.

## Mission Statement
1. To establish a clinical trial alliance for systemic autoimmune rheumatism in Taiwan, to facilitate the implementation of standardized multi-center clinical trials of immune rheumatism, and to enhance the international competitiveness of Taiwan's new drug applications and clinical trials in this disease.
2. Through international multinational drug clinical trials and international seminars, it promotes international academic exchanges and information and resources shared by members of the Alliance, and fosters international clinical trial leaders.
3. Establish an autoantibody detection platform, perform biological specimen testing, provide the best basis for clinical diagnosis, and discover novel biomarkers, and conduct relevant clinical trials initiated by the moderator.
4. Collect and collect the clinical information, test results and clinical trial results from the Alliance, establish an electronic clinical database, and combine the database of the Ministry of Health and Welfare to enable the members of the Alliance to apply the basis for basic and clinical research and the development of the biomedical industry. Establish the best diagnosis and treatment strategy for SARD.
5. Using artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning technology, big data analysis for integrated electronic database to develop accurate prediction mode of SARD (personalized treatment).
